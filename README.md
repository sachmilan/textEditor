## Description

-Text editing can be a headache, as most of them ask for a sybscription fee. So this gave me an idea to create a text editing app which will run free of cost.

-To achieve my goal, I created JATE, In it you can type and save your data in the cache, plus it gives you the iption to download it on you machine.

-Java script was totally new to me, so I learned it and used it in a way which enhances my understanding of it.

## Table of contents

You can always look at the HTML code and the CSS styling  which I use.
